Tanzella SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA Abstract The ability of palladium cathodes to attain and maintain high loading levels, at high","
the ability of palladium cathodes to attain and maintain high loading levels, at high
current density and for long times, is controlled by two factors: the condition of the
electrochemical interface which allows the attainment of high deuterium activity; the defect
density and mechanical condition of the bulk material which permits the pd lattice to withstand
and contain high bulk deuterium activities when these equilibrate to produce extreme pressures of
deuterium gas inside closed incipient voids within the metal.
examples are given from a set of 26 intentionally similar current ramps which show
three distinct modes of loading performance: mode a - a linear decrease of pd resistance,
beyond the resistance maximum, with logarithmic increase in electrochemical current; mode b -an
initial log-linear decrease on the mode a trajectory, followed by a rapid increase in resistance
when the resistance falls below a critical value; mode c - a shallow decrease in resistance with
approximately symmetric increase as the [log] current density is increased beyond a threshold
value similar to that for mode b. mode a is most frequently associated with the appearance of
calorimetrically determined excess heat.

implantation experiments of very low energy (lkev <e<18kev ) hydrogen ions on hydrogen
loaded metals have been performed with high beam density (jmax.~1.2 mncm2) and weak beam
density (j min.~ 0.02 mncm2). palladium and titanium foils (plates) have been bombarded with proton
and deuteron beams in order to compare the atomic and nuclear interactions between different ion
beams. x ray and charged particles have been measured, and neutron and gamma doses were also
monitored during implanting experiments. an anomalous peak in x-spectra, which energy is about
four times of beam energy, has been observed during high beam density experiment. the peak moved
from about 40 kev to 62 kev and fwhm reduced rapidly, while the beam energy and intensity
increased. another wide peak with over twice of the beam energy has been measured in experiment
with low beam density. this peak located between 16 and 30 kev, and its peak position grew with the
growth of integrated implantation dose (implantation time). some anomalous intensities of neutrons
correlated with a charged particle peak (3-4 mev) have been also observed in deuteron-palladium

electron beam irradiation and ion-beam bombardment on titanium-deuteride (tidx) have been
introduced in this paper. in the electrolysis experiment, upper gas of the electrolysis cell was analyzed
using a quadrupole mass analysis system (q-mas). significant amount of helium-4 was detected
without neutron emission in several experiments and in one of these experiments, the amount of
helium-4 atom in the released gas from the palladium cathode was 8.1x1016 atoms. under electron
beam irradiation to highly d-loaded palladium, anomalous spectra were taken in x-ray measurement.
in the experiments using deuteron beam and tidx, responses which suggested 3d multi-body fusion
were taken and the reaction rate of which was increased compared to the d(d,p)t reaction rate, below
100 kev. this result may reflect the coherent effect of the solid state in the reactions. from the results
of the experiments using proton beam and tidx, peaks which suggested 3d multi-body reaction were
detected with high reproducibility. moreover, high energetic protons having 17-20 mev emitted
kinetic energy which suggested h-d-d three-body coherent fusion were also detected.

0,doc25.pdf,Femto-Helium and PdD Transmutation,"
extensive evidence exists for cold fusion to produce transmutation products as well as excess heat. this paper deals with the
palladium–deuteride (pdd) structure that is generally modeled with a deuterium-to-helium (d + d 4he) cold-fusion process.
⇒
how this process results in transmutation is based on the extended-lochon model that predicts deep-orbit electrons that are tightly
bound to the 4he nucleus and thus make the equivalent of a neutralized alpha particle. this model is compared with the nih system
(h + h d, h##, or 2h#) described earlier and distinguishes long-range from short-range transmutation (distance from the fusion
⇒ 2
site) as well as the relative excess energies from fusion vs. transmutation. the model predicts the probable transmutation process(es)
and products in the palladium system and explains other observed results of cold-fusion experiments.

a burst-like excess heat release, equivalent to 110% of the input electric power,
was clearly observed for the first time in our newly built open type electrolysis cell using
pd/0.l mliod/pt. after being precharged, the cell was driven to boiling three times the

during the calm period about 6 hours after the first boiling. the temperature of the cell,
about 100 ml in volume, increased by 7.5 kin 13 minutes. a palladium cathode, 2mm¢>
x 7.05mm, was a heat source, although the mechanism of the heat generation is still
uncertain. during the whole period of this run, however, the phenomenon took place
only once. neither increase of neutron emission nor that of tritium concentration has
been detected. mass analysis showed that any traces of d2 as well as 4he have not
remained in the pd sample used. detection of 'yray emission as well as 3he and 4he in
off gas during or just after release of excess power should be yet to be pursued further.

are the products (the fleishmann pons heat effect). consistent with the tendency of di-neutrons to cluster, multiple di-neutrons are
occasionally captured yielding neutron heavy nuclei. this is followed by beta decay and the respective isotonic products. we show
that, within the pdd matrix, these di-neutron reactions involve phonon enforced quantum tunneling. the di-neutron-phonon mech-
anism fully accounts for the following: (1) the evolved heat commensurate with 4he production, (2) the production of tritium when
small amounts of 1h are present, (3) the release of feeble neutrons, (4) the formation of pr when cs is present, (5) the ostensive
intermittent reproducibility and erratic (chaotic) heat out-puts, and (6) the seemingly major problem of obfuscating the coulombic
repulsion issue. indeed, the antics of the di-neutron can fully explain the important aspects of normal temperature lenr heat
effects and transmutations. further, the di-neutron paradigm (mechanism) falls within the normal bounds of the standard model,
and it is without the necessity of exotic forms of matter.

heterogeneous hydrocarbon plasma (hhp) was used in lenr experiments in the studies [1], [2] for the first time. this hhp
was created by a pulsed erosive capillary plasma generator (pg). the working erosive substance pmma (polymethyl-methacrylate,

carbon nano-clusters and hydrogen atoms + hydrogen ions. these species are connected with dissociation of the initial pmma.
the interaction of hhp with thin ni-foil target (width 0.1 ÷ 1 mm) has been studied in this work. hhp- jet heats, melts and
evaporates this thin ni-foil target. in a result of this interaction a small hole with diameter 1–3 mm in the ni-foil target was burned

revealed that the value cop was about of 5 ÷ 6 in this experiment (where cop = qt/qe, qt – thermal energy of heating, melting

beam bombardment for 15 < e < 60 kev. observed energy spectra and yield excitation functions are anomalous and suggest that
the target deuteron is also in motion. it is found that the reaction mechanism is unique to the molecular beam in such a way that one
deuteron in a molecule is elastically scattered by a host metal atom and then it collides with the other to cause the d+d reaction.
we call it as the cooperative colliding mechanism (ccm). experimental data are compared with the ccm calculation and values of
the screening energy of the d+d reaction are deduced. they are 380 80, 570 80, 670 100 and 490 100 ev for in, sn, pb

utilization of graphite as an anode is advantageous because it avoids anode-driven contamination and establishes a distinct upper
bound in the fusion products (cu), which is different from upper bounds in previous studies (pb or ag) with a pt anode. whenever
isotopic shifts were measured following transmutation, they differed from the natural ratios. pure ni cathode predominantly trans-
mutes to fe and cu, pure cu cathode transmutes to fe and mg, kanthal shows the appearance of cu and mg and the ni-fe alloy
transmutes to mg and cu. while the extent of transmutation in pure cathodes is a few tens of percent after about twelve hours of
cathodic hydrogen loading (chl), kanthal and ni-fe alloy show comparable or larger amounts of transmutations in less than an

there is a small literature on the combination of low energy nuclear reactions (lenr) experiments and radiofrequencies (rf).
the papers are worth attention in case they can teach anything about the mechanisms behind lenr. application of rf to lenr
electrochemical cells in the mid-1990s clearly showed increases in the production of excess power. more recently, rf have been
measured in lenr cells. however, it is still possible that those data are artifacts of the operation of the system, and not indicative of
lenr. it has been suggested that the appearance of rf in lenr experiments is the cause of lenr, and not merely a manifestation
of such reactions. that possibility has significant implications. in the present paper, we summarize and analyze the results obtained
by different research groups concerning the application and emission of rf in the khz to ghz range associated with heat production

the study of the fleischmann–pons effect (fpe), i.e. the production of excess power production during electrochemical loading
of deuterium in palladium (in the past labeled cold fusion) has had a notably multidisciplinary character, involving solid state and
nuclear physics, material science, electrochemistry and other fields. correlations between the material status and the occurrence of
the effect as well as some changes in the electrochemical interface status have been observed. although during the last two decades,
in several calorimetric experiments the effect was observed to be well above the measurement uncertainty, the mechanism producing
the excess power is not completely understood. so far, the lack of reproducibility has been responsible for the absence of a clear
explanation of the phenomenon based on experimental apparatus designed to enhance the spectrum of information required to
define the effect. recently, in order to improve this aspect of this research, specific work has been carried out to investigate whether
the excess power was produced concurrently with the emission of radio frequency from the active cathode. suitable probes
and triggering included in the rf experimental system revealed rf signal emission during electrochemical loading of palladium
samples, and a correlation between the heat production, in active samples, and rf signal emission was found. the preliminary
results highlight the importance of performing studies on the electrodynamic effects that may be involved in the phenomenon, and
the importance of the design of appropriate instruments designed to investigate unexplored regions of metal hydrogen systems.

can be usually obtained by electrolysis or by a pyrolysis reaction at high temperatures, starting

can occur during plasma electrolysis, and this process makes it rather easy to achieve both
electrolysis and pyrolysis simultaneously. in this paper we describe anomalous amounts of
hydrogen and oxygen gas generated during plasma electrolysis. the generation of hydrogen far
in excess of amounts predicted by faraday’s law is continuously observed when conditions such
as temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable. non-faraday
generation of hydrogen gas sometimes produces more than 80 times as much hydrogen as
normal electrolysis does. unfortunately there have been few claimed replications of excess
hydrogen, even in rare cases in which excess heat is claimed. in most cases, no excess heat or
hydrogen is observed. the reaction products found after electrolysis were different after excess

the separate beam power must be 107 – 108 w). the emission of the x-ray laser beams occurred
when the discharge occurred and within 100 ms after turning off the current. the results of
experimental research into the characteristics of secondary penetrating radiation occurring when
interacting primary x-ray beams from a solid-state cathode medium with targets made of various
materials are reported. it was shown that the secondary radiation consisted of fast electrons.
secondary radiation of two types was observed: 1. the emission with a continuous temporal
spectrum in the form of separate bursts with intensity up to 106 fast electrons a burst. 2. the
emission with a discrete temporal spectrum and emission rate up to 1010 fast electrons a burst. a
third type of the penetrating radiation was observed as well. this type was recorded directly by
the photomultiplier placed behind of the target without the scintillator. the abnormal high
penetrating ability of this radiation type requires additional research to explain. the obtained
results show that creating optically active medium with long-living metastable levels with the

h on an average, a part of the nickel electrode, which by this time had become black, was taken for elemental analysis using energy
dispersive spectroscopy (eds). the eds analysis showed that a whole host of new elements had appeared on the cathode such as:
k, fe, cu, o, rh, zr and pb. the apparent concentration of the elements varied from just over a percent for k and pb to about 10%
for rh and 20% for cu. the sample was then taken to a time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (tof-sims) for isotopic

significantly from the ratio found in naturally occurring ni. it was clear that in the electrolyzed ni the concentrations of 60ni and
62ni had gone down compared to the concentration of 58ni. this is a clear indication that nuclear reactions had taken place during

peak at 3.2mevwas observed, when a pre-loading 1idx was applied. this peak became
evidently, following the implantation dose. therefore, it is considered as the alpha peak
from d-t secondary reaction. its maximum ratio to d-d reaction reached 0.0015. this
ratio was much higher than prediction value based on the secondary reaction of d-d
fusion. some unknown high energy counts located from 3.5mevto 17mevin charged
particle spectra has been observed for many times. sometimes the counts concentrated
in limited area, which appeared like a peak but poor statistics. the phenomena were
dij]icult to be reproduced. in the x-ray spectra, there were many characteristic peaks
from fe, ni, cu, zn, as, zr, ru, pd etc elements. the gamma radiation up to 30mev
was measured with a hpge detector. comparing to background, the intensity of
foreground was a few orders higher. there was also a few counts distributed around
17mevand 24mev, which might be the gamma ray from d(d, y )'he reactions.

4,doc20.pdf,Searching for excess heat in Mizuno-type plasma electrolysis,"
excess heat generated in the glow discharge plasma electrolysis, first reported by
mizuno and ohmori (1), has been studied by several researchers, both in japan (2,
3, 4) and in other countries (5, 6, 7, 8). most reports, but not all, confirmed
generation of excess heat. facing this situation we decided to replicate the most
recent experiment (8) in which excess heat was reported to increase with voltage.
our results do not confirm reality of excess heat.

4,doc30.pdf,Is the Abundance of Elements in Earth’s Crust Correlated with LENR Transmutation Rates?,"
nuclear transmutations are reported in many low-energy nuclear reaction (lenr) experiments. we showed in a previous study
(scholkmann and nagel, j. condensed matter nucl. sci. 13 (2014) 485–494) that (i) the transmutation data of three independent
experiments have a similar pattern and (ii) this pattern correlates with a model-based on the prediction of widom and larsen (wl).
in the present study, we extended our analysis and investigated whether the abundance of elements in earth’s crust is correlated with
either (i) the wl-prediction, or (ii) the three lenr transmutation data sets. the first analysis revealed that there is no statistically
significant correlation between these variables. the second analysis showed a significant correlation, but the correlation only
reflects the trend of the data and not the peak-like pattern. this result strengthens the interpretation that the observed peak-like
pattern in the transmutation data sets does not originate from contamination. further implications of our study are discussed and a
recommendation is given for future transmutation experiments.
